To build the pysquid Python module first copy *.c and *.h from
the libsquid source directory to this one.  Update the version number
in setup.py to match the one in libsquid.h.

Then run the following:
> python setup.py build_ext --inplace
Note that you don't need to have built the libsquid library itself for
this to work.

After that, the file pysquid.py and _pysquid.so should
be created.  At this point, you should be able to do the following in
python:

import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/pysquid/directory')
import pysquid

To build the pysquid rpm, run the following:
> python setup.py bdist_rpm
The rpm will be placed in the "dist" subdirectory.
